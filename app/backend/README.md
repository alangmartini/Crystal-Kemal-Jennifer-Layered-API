This API allows you to manage travel plans. The following endpoints are available:

## Endpoints

### `GET /travel_plans`

Retrieves a list of all travel plans.

### `GET /travel_plans/:id`

- `optimise=true`: Optimises the travel stops according to the following rules:
  1. Every stop from the same dimension must be grouped.
  2. Inside a same dimension, the stops must be ordered in ascending order of popularity.
  3. If the popularity is the same, then order by name.
  4. The order of visit of the dimensions is defined by the average of their total populations.

- `expand=true`: Brings information on travel stop name, dimension, and type.

### `POST /travel_plans`

Creates a new travel plan.

### `PUT /travel_plans/:id`
